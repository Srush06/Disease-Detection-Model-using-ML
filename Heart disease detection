Heart Disease Detection Model Using Python
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics. Using Python and popular machine learning libraries, the model analyzes input data (such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc.) and classifies whether an individual is at risk of heart disease.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data for training.
Model Training: Implement machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest to train the model.
Evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s accuracy using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Visualization: Use Python's libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the data and model performance.

Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebooks (for easy code execution and visualization)
Installation
To run the model, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

Usage
Once the dependencies are installed, run the notebook heart_disease_detection.ipynb to see the full workflow of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset
The model uses a publicly available heart disease dataset, which includes attributes like age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more.

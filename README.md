Heart Disease Detection Model Using Python

This project focuses on building an interactive machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics. Leveraging Python and powerful machine learning libraries, the system classifies whether an individual is at risk of heart disease based on inputs like age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure. Additionally, the project includes interactive visualizations and a user-friendly interface for better usability.

Features

1. Data Preprocessing

Interactive Cleaning: Handle missing values and outliers with clear visual feedback.

Feature Engineering: Apply scaling, encoding, and feature selection for optimal performance.


2. Model Training

Implement multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest) with an option to compare their results.

Enable users to select algorithms interactively for training.


3. Evaluation

Visualize performance metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix interactively.

Use interactive plots to show algorithm comparisons (e.g., ROC curves).


4. Visualization

Interactive data exploration with filters and dynamic plots using Python libraries such as Plotly and Dash.

Visualize trends in health metrics to understand risk factors better.


5. User Interaction

Add a web-based interface for users to input health metrics and get predictions dynamically.

Include a risk assessment dashboard to display predictions and suggestions.
